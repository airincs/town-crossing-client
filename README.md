## Reflection

Developing Town Crossing taught me a lot! It was a great opportunity for me to refine my frontend skills and to gain backend experience. There were a lot of small details and problems that I had to push through, which ultimately helped me grow substantially as a developer. While I'm happy with the process and the results, in retrospect I would have also developed the project with a testing tool such as Jest or React-Testing-Library.
